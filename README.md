## 📖 Project Description

Traditional ticketing systems are prone to issues like **fraud, double-selling, and fake tickets**.  
This decentralized solution uses **blockchain technology** to store all ticket sales transparently on-chain.

Event organizers can create events, users can purchase tickets with Ether, and everyone can verify ownership directly through the smart contract.

Built as a learning project for blockchain beginners who want to understand:
- How Solidity contracts work
- How Ether payments are handled securely
- How to store and verify on-chain data

## 💡 What It Does

1. **Create Events:**  
   The organizer defines the event name, date, price, and total tickets.

2. **Buy Tickets:**  
   Users purchase tickets directly by sending ETH to the contract.

3. **Proof of Purchase:**  
   Every purchase is recorded permanently on-chain — making ownership verifiable.

4. **Verify Ownership:**  
   Anyone can check if a given wallet owns tickets for a specific event.
